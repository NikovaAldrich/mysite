    <h3>Artsy</h3>
    <p>People with this aesthetic tend to like art(hence the name), yellow, mom jeans, sandals, and of course, the kanken rucksack. It is also typical for them to have Van Gogh socks.

<h3>Baddie
</h3>
<p>Well, its not. At least to the everyday person. However, it can play a huge part in someone's brand online, and help them create a loyal following of people who share similar tastes.

<p>An easy way to figure out what aesthetic you have, is to look through a list of aesthetics, and see which one your fashion sense/sense of beauty fits with most. You can find some general descriptions of generl aesthetics In the navigstion bar. for some people however, their taste doesnt fit perfectly into one general aesthetic. So many people have created sub-aesthetics that branch off of a main or that combine two aesthetics.</p>
<h3>Pastel</h3>
<h3>Vintage</h3>
