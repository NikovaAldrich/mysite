    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <h3>What Is An Aestetic?</h3>
    <p>Aesthetic is the pleasant, positive or artful appearance of a person or a thing. In fashion it is a common element of appearance of someones wardrobe. A person's aesthetic can also include objects they collect or use to decorate the things around them as well. For example, a person who collects old vinyls and wears ripped jeans along with band T-shirts, might have the grunge aesthetic. Aesthetics stretch so far as having a certain style when editing photos to post online.

<h3>Why Is Aesthetic Important?
</h3>
<p>Well, its not. At least to the everyday person. However, it can play a huge part in someone's brand online, and help them create a loyal following of people who share similar tastes.
</p>
<h3>How Do I Figure Out My Aesthtic?</h3>
<p>An easy way to figure out what aesthetic you have, is to look through a list of aesthetics, and see which one your fashion sense/sense of beauty fits with most. You can find some general descriptions of generl aesthetics In the navigstion bar. for some people however, their taste doesnt fit perfectly into one general aesthetic. So many people have created sub-aesthetics that branch off of a main or that combine two aesthetics.</p>
